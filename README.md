# movies-with-react
 Movies With React is an app built using React and The Movie Database API. When you first land on the main page, it shows you a list of newly released movies. You may also use the search bar to find specific movies. When you click on a movie, it will give you various information about it such as the release date, the rating, genre, summary as well as the cast. I'm a big movie person so I wanted to be able to stay up to date with all the new releases and this app does exactly that.

This is the main page, displaying the newest movie releases (as of June 17, 2018)
